# Authentication Persistence Fixes

## Problem
The app was treating users as guest users after every refresh or app restart, even when they had created accounts and were previously authenticated.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Firebase Auth State Listener Issues**: The `onAuthStateChanged` listener wasn't properly handling authentication state restoration
2. **Guest User Creation Logic**: The app was creating guest users even when authenticated users existed
3. **Session Restoration**: The `checkExistingAuthSession` function wasn't working correctly
4. **Token Management**: Auth tokens weren't being properly stored and restored
5. **Corrupted Auth Data**: Inconsistent authentication state between different storage mechanisms

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Improved Auth State Management
- Enhanced `checkAuthState` function with better logging and error handling
- Added proper session restoration logic before creating guest users
- Improved Firebase auth state listener to handle user sign-out properly

### 2. Enhanced Session Restoration
- Improved `checkExistingAuthSession` function to check multiple sources:
  - Firebase current user
  - Stored authentication tokens
  - Last authenticated user data
  - Offline mode tokens
- Added fallback mechanisms for different authentication scenarios

### 3. Better Guest User Logic
- Modified `createGuestUser` to check for existing authenticated users first
- Prevented guest user creation when authenticated users exist
- Added proper logging for debugging guest user creation

### 4. Improved Token Management
- Enhanced login and register functions to properly store auth tokens
- Added proper token validation and cleanup
- Improved logout function to clear all authentication data

### 5. Corrupted Data Cleanup
- Added `clearCorruptedAuthData` function to detect and clear inconsistent auth state
- Implemented automatic cleanup on app startup
- Added validation to prevent corrupted data from causing issues

### 6. Debugging Tools
- Enhanced `AuthDebugger` component with comprehensive authentication state information
- Added logging throughout authentication flow for better debugging
- Created `forceAuthRestore` function for manual authentication restoration

## Key Changes Made

### AuthContext.tsx
- Enhanced `checkAuthState` with better session restoration
- Improved `checkExistingAuthSession` with multiple fallback mechanisms
- Modified `createGuestUser` to respect existing authenticated users
- Added `clearCorruptedAuthData` function
- Enhanced login/register/logout functions with better token management
- Added comprehensive logging throughout

### AuthDebugger.tsx
- Complete rewrite with better debugging information
- Added ability to view all authentication state
- Added function to clear all auth data for testing
- Made it only visible in development mode

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Create an account** and verify you stay logged in after app restart
2. **Use the AuthDebugger** (üîß button in top-right corner in development) to check authentication state
3. **Test the force restore** function if needed
4. **Clear auth data** using the debugger if you encounter issues

## Debugging Commands

The app now includes comprehensive logging. Look for these log messages:
- `üöÄ Setting up authentication...` - App startup
- `üîç Checking for existing auth session...` - Session restoration
- `‚úÖ Session restored successfully for: [email]` - Successful restoration
- `üë§ Creating guest user...` - Guest user creation
- `‚ùå No valid session found` - No session to restore

## Prevention Measures

1. **Automatic cleanup** of corrupted auth data on app startup
2. **Multiple fallback mechanisms** for session restoration
3. **Comprehensive logging** for debugging issues
4. **Validation checks** before creating guest users
5. **Proper token management** with SecureStore

## Notes

- The fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing user data
- Guest user functionality is preserved for users who haven't created accounts
- All authentication flows (Firebase and offline mode) are supported
- The debugger is only available in development mode
