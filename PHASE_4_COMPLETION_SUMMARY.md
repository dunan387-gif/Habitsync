  - Course impact display and applied knowledge tracking
  - Next learning recommendations
  - Cross-feature insights from library integration
  - Learning-habit correlation analysis

### **4.3 Cross-Tab Integration**
- ✅ **Cross-Tab Analytics Hooks**
  - `useHomeAnalytics()` - Home tab data and insights
  - `useLibraryAnalytics()` - Library and learning analytics
  - `useGamificationAnalytics()` - Gamification and engagement data
  - `useSettingsAnalytics()` - Settings and personalization insights

- ✅ **Unified Data Flow**
  - Cross-tab data aggregation through `CrossTabInsightsContext`
  - Real-time data synchronization
  - Context-aware insight generation
  - Performance-optimized data processing

## 🏗️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Core Components**
```typescript
// Simplified analytics structure
const renderSimplifiedOverview = () => (
  <View style={styles.simplifiedAnalyticsContainer}>
    <TodayFocusCard 
      insight={homeAnalytics.todayFocus}
      compact={false}
    />
    <WeeklyProgressCard 
      progress={homeAnalytics.weeklyProgress}
      compact={false}
    />
    <LearningImpactCard 
      impact={libraryAnalytics.learningImpact}
      compact={false}
    />
    <CrossTabInsightsSummary />
  </View>
);
```

### **Cross-Tab Data Integration**
```typescript
// Analytics hooks providing contextual data
const homeAnalytics = useHomeAnalytics();
const libraryAnalytics = useLibraryAnalytics();
const gamificationAnalytics = useGamificationAnalytics();
const settingsAnalytics = useSettingsAnalytics();
```

### **Simplified Wellness Integration**
```typescript
// Basic wellness tracking (Phase 4 simplified)
const handleAddWellness = () => {
  Alert.alert(
    t('stats.wellness.title'),
    t('stats.wellness.comingSoon'),
    [{ text: 'OK' }]
  );
};
```
