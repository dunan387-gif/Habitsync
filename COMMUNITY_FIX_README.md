# Community Database Fix

## Problem
The community feature was failing with the error:
```
Could not find a relationship between 'community_posts' and 'community_users' in the schema cache
```

This was caused by:
1. Incorrect foreign key relationships in the database schema
2. Use of `!inner` joins in Supabase queries that require strict foreign key relationships
3. Missing or improperly configured database tables

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed SupabaseCommunityService.ts
- Removed `!inner` joins and replaced with regular joins
- Added fallback logic to handle cases where joins fail
- Added `transformSimplePostToInterface` method for posts without user data
- Made queries more resilient to database relationship issues

### 2. Created Migration File
- Created `supabase/migrations/003_fix_community_tables.sql`
- This migration properly sets up all community tables with correct foreign key relationships
- Includes proper indexes, triggers, and RLS policies
- Adds sample data for testing

### 3. Updated Deploy Script
- Simplified `supabase/deploy.sh` to apply migrations and deploy functions

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Using the Migration (Recommended)
1. Run the migration to fix the database schema:
   ```bash
   cd supabase
   supabase db push
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Database Setup
If the migration doesn't work, you can manually run the SQL from `003_fix_community_tables.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor.

### Option 3: Reset and Recreate
If you're still having issues:
1. Drop all community tables manually in Supabase
2. Run the migration file
3. Restart your app

## Testing the Fix

After applying the fix, test the community features:

1. **Check the community feed** - Should load without errors
2. **Create a post** - Should work without foreign key errors
3. **Like/unlike posts** - Should update counters properly
4. **Add comments** - Should work with proper user relationships

## Key Changes Made

### Database Schema
- Proper foreign key relationships between `community_users`, `community_posts`, and `community_interactions`
- Correct indexes for performance
- Proper RLS policies for anonymous users
- Triggers for automatic counter updates

### Service Layer
- More resilient query patterns
- Fallback logic for failed joins
- Better error handling
- Support for posts without user data

## Troubleshooting

If you still see errors:

1. **Check Supabase Dashboard** - Verify tables exist and have correct relationships
2. **Check RLS Policies** - Ensure policies allow the operations you need
3. **Check Function Logs** - Look for any remaining errors in Supabase function logs
4. **Test with Simple Queries** - Try basic SELECT queries in Supabase SQL editor

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the migration to your Supabase project
2. Test the community features
3. Monitor for any remaining errors
4. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling if needed

The fix should resolve the foreign key relationship errors and allow the community features to work properly.
